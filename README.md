# Cloud Project

## Description
This program that I wrote is the basis for a date night app. It keeps track of users and comapres the liked activites of both to see what they both want to do. Everything is kept in a cloud database hosted by Google.

This was a project for me to learn about how Google's Firebase works with interactive scripts. It was also to start the foundation for an app idea.

# Cloud Database
The databse I am using uses NoSql organization. The structure is very different from a relational database. The database is hosted by Firebase by Google. 

The collections I created are the activites, users, and the liked activites. They each have their own documents. 

## Plans
* I plan to implement this into an app. 
* No repeating liked activites in the database
* Fix matching activities
* Add pictures to the activites


## Environment
* VS Code
* Python
